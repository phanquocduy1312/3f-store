description: Create an implementation plan without research
---

Quick planning — no research phase, analyze and plan directly.

## Workflow

1. **Scout** codebase for relevant files
2. **Analyze** requirements against existing code
3. **Create** plan in `./plans/` directory
4. **Report** plan summary

## Report Output

Save to `plans/{YYMMDD}-{HHMM}-{slug}/`:
- `reports/scout-{slug}.md` — codebase analysis
- `plan.md` — overview with YAML frontmatter (under 80 lines)
- `phase-XX-{name}.md` — detailed phase files

## Notes
- Skips research phase entirely
- Uses existing codebase knowledge
- Faster but less thorough than `/plan-hard`
- **Do not** start implementing
