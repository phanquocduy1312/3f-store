description: Bootstrap project with parallel execution
---

Bootstrap with parallel phase execution for maximum speed.

## Workflow

1. **Analyze** requirements and create plan
2. **Execute phases in parallel** where dependencies allow:
   - Frontend + Backend simultaneously
   - Tests + Documentation simultaneously
3. **Merge** parallel results
4. **Verify** integration
5. **Report** summary

## Report Output

Same as `/bootstrap` — save reports to `./plans/reports/` using `{type}-{YYMMDD}-{HHMM}-{slug}.md`.
Plan saved to `plans/{YYMMDD}-{HHMM}-{slug}/`.

## Notes
- Phases without dependencies execute simultaneously
- File ownership boundaries prevent conflicts
- Fastest bootstrap approach for multi-component projects
